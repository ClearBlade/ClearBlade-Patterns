# Using the ClearBlade Platform to enhance Dropbox access control

A user can store his Dropbox authorization credentials in a Collection. He can then choose to give access to his Dropbox credentials via a Code Service only to the users/devices that are authenticated with the ClearBlade Platform. 

Copy and paste the code from getDropboxAccess.js into a new Code Service and you are all set!
